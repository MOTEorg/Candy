# Initial axiom
## Necessary condition to make a start point.
1. You understand the following axioms.


# Philosophical principles
## All other axioms are based on these ones
1. Not contradiction: A can't be A and not-A in the same sense or meaning of to be simulteanosly A 
2. Identity: A is A
3. Exclusion: A or not-A (Binarism)
4. If A=C and A=B then A=C=B (Identity of Indiscernibles)
5. All can be explained (Enough reason)
6. All in movimment need a cause that is already in movement. (Casuality principle (Energy conservartion))
8. An effect is produced by something that can in someway produce this effect. (Proportional causality)
7. Orientation and directionality. (Ending principle (Entropy))
8. the simplest solution is most likely the right one (Okham knife)


# Physical Axioms
## Valid for all levels
1. The velocity of the light is constant.
2. The energy in a closed system is constant.
3. The relation E=sqroot(mc^2+c^2p^2).
4. The space-time is the container of energy. (Conservation is possible given the system is closed)
5. The systems tend to the equilibrium in some sense.
6. The description is simplest with duality.
7. There is complexity.

3. We determine values with costs and rewards.
4. More demand needs more offer.
5. More offer decreases the costs rising. 
6. More demand decreases value.
7. The demand is not perfectly correlated to a necessity.
8. We add feelings related rewards to the things.
